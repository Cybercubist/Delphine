**The task**: Create a small lightweighted platform for fast 1-page texts analysis. Texts are going to be on financial topic. It should be handy for everyday use.

**Update 17.11.2023:** 
1. Added "find sentence" function. Now you can find a sentence which contains words, entities, numbers or chunks you are interested in.
2. Small architecture improvements. Data extraction part and visualization part are now in separated cells. Lists (for example trash token list) are now in a separated file.
